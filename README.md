# TrackTEAM

I didn't want to call it "Contact Management". So there you go.

## Notes:

1. I enjoyed this mini hackathon
2. I did what I could in the one evening that I had.
3. I used jsonPlaceholder to mock the backend so I had to stick with their available data models
4. I Had issues cloning the original repo, hence this repo. 

## Thanks
